By Marc Davis (10/22/2020)

  Hardware requirements: Arduino Mega 2560 R3; RFID RC 522; Cytron WiFi Shield; Compatible
  vacuum fluorescent display or LCD; if using an LCD then modifications will be required.

  Modifications will be required if using wired ethernet or another WiFi Shield

  Software requirements: You will need my modified version of IeeFlipNoFrills.h which fixes
  compatibility issues with newer Arduino IDE.

  NOTE: BETTORSLOTS File Modifications may be required on its SD card! Check your SD card
  for the Data.html file. This file should be blank; otherwise the app will have trouble
  reading the data.
