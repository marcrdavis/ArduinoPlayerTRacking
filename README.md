# Arduino TITO and Player Tracking
A homebrew slot machine TITO, player tracking and display project
By Marc Davis (10/23/2022)

  Project goals: To allow home slot machine owners the ability to add Ticket In/Ticket Out (TITO), 
  Remote Control, Monitoring and Player Tracking (Display/Keypad/Reader) to their SAS-Compatible 
  games using an Arduino Mega 2560 and reusing existing player tracking hardware
  
  The project now includes sketches for TITO-only hardware based on the Arduino UNO and compatible 
  with the BETTORSlots TITO and TITO Deluxe hardware. Please see the included documentation for
  more details.

  NEW! The MEGA sketches now support ESP8266 WiFi! The easiest way is to use the Songhe Mega2560 + WiFi R3; 
  or you can use any compatible ESP8266 module

  Build 20221023 Updates
  
  THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE CONFIG.TXT FILE IN THIS BUILD! PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CONFIG.TXT FILE AS PER THE DOCUMENTATION
  
  - Adds support for ESP8266 WiFi via the Songhe Mega2560 + WiFi R3 board; other ESP8266 implementations may work as well
  - Adds support for the Futaba NA202SD08FA display using the included FutabaVFD library
  - Adds support for the XS Technologies PI70-120-TLA-DFR magnetic card reader using the included MagStripeSerial library
  - Updates to the MagStripe library; if you are using a MagStripe reader you must update your library with the included newer version or the sketch will not compile
  - Updated documentation with wiring for new supported hardware
  - Github package cleaned up and reorganized
  
  Build 20220726 Updates
  
  - Updates to MEGA Sketches only
  - Fixes an issue where comp credits could go negative
    
  Build 20220617 Updates
  
  - Updates to MEGA Sketches only
  - Adds 'autoAddCredits' feature which will automatically add the number of credits specified in 'changeCredits'
    to the game when the credit meter is less than or equal to the 'creditFloor' value in the config file. To prevent
    excessive polling the check only runs after the attract message resets; so it could take up to 30 seconds for the
    credits to be added to the game

  Build 20220607 Updates
  
  - Updates to TITO and TITO Deluxe sketches only; due to memory issues in the Deluxe sketch I have had to remove
    the config.txt file support; the settings need to be applied to the sketch directly before downloading to 
    the UNO. This will increase stability of the Deluxe sketch.
  - Minor updates to the SAS portion of the code

  Build 20211112 Updates
  
  - Fixes an issue with DHCP renewal
 
  Build 20211031 Updates
  
  - Fixes an issue with the Update Ticket Text function where the 2nd address line would not be saved correctly
  - Adds new sketches: Arduino TITO and TITO Deluxe; a TITO only Arduino Uno solution compatible with BETTORSlots hardware

  Build 20210818 Updates
  
  - Added option on WebUI to set/change the comp credit value on the inserted player card
  - Restored the Handpay Reset option to the WebUI
  - Fixed the issue which was preventing the index.htm file from being updated by Game Manager
  - Fixed an issue where under certain conditions comp credits would be removed from the card before being successfully applied to game
  
  Build 20210814 Updates
  
  - WebUI updated to include Reboot Arduino option; replaces Jackpot Reset button on UI
  - Adds IP Address and Version information by pressing 0 on the keypad when in Attract mode
  - Minor code changes
  
  EXPERIMENTAL BUILD 20210522C
  
  Included in this package is an experimental version of the MAGSTRIPE sketch that includes support for the ArduCam OV2640_MINI_2MP_PLUS 
  Camera Module for the purpose of implementing a 'Jackpot Winner' Photo. Admins can set a minimum jackpot amount at which a photo will
  be taken of the player. The photo can be seen or downloaded using the Web UI. This is an experimental feature and is NOT RECOMMENDED 
  for novice users as it requires modification of the cabinet or player tracking bracket to accommodate the camera. This feature is also 
  only compatible with the MAGSTRIPE version due to limits in the SPI bus. Please see the Addendum PDF in the download for more information. 
  I make no promises that this code will make it into the main branch.
  
   Build 20210425 Updates
  
  - Adds support for 8-bit LCDs
  - Adds support for the Noritake CU20025ECPB-U1J display using the LiquidCrystal library in 8 bit mode
  - Updates to documentation including the make/model # of the supported magnetic reader
 
   Build 20210325 Updates
  
  - This build corrects many (if not all) of the compiler warnings generated by the code during compile; no other functional changes in this version
 
   Build 20210324 Updates
  
  - Fixes a potential issue in the setupPlayerMessage function where some pseudo-code was left in a conditional statement 
  - Fixes an issue in the MAG version where some debug code was left in a conditional statement when testing if SAS was available
  - Cleans up the waitForResponse function by removing the deprecated byte return value 

   Build 20210316 Updates

  - Improved documentation

   Build 20210312 Updates
  
  - Fixes a bug where the Update Player Name function on the Web UI was not working properly
  - Game Manager: This version removes the ability to remotely update the index.htm file due to 
    a problem with the file being saved incorrectly by the Arduino - probably due to a buffer size
    issue; Will revisit this later. The config.txt file can still be updated from Game Manager.
