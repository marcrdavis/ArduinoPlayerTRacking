# Arduino TITO and Player Tracking
A homebrew slot machine TITO, player tracking and display project
By Marc Davis (5/24/2021)

  Project goals: To allow home slot machine owners the ability to add Ticket In/Ticket Out (TITO), 
  Remote Control, Monitoring and Player Tracking (Display/Keypad/Reader) to their SAS-Compatible 
  games using an Arduino Mega 2560 and reusing existing player tracking hardware

  NOTE: As of Build 20210314 there are now two versions of the sketch file in the package; one for RFID and one for
  magnetic stripe readers. Determine which you want to use and modify the file as needed for your display and keypad options.
  
  EXPERIMENTAL BUILD 20210522C
  
  Included in this package is an experimental version of the MAGSTRIPE sketch that includes support for the ArduCam OV2640_MINI_2MP_PLUS 
  Camera Module for the purpose of implementing a 'Jackpot Winner' Photo. Admins can set a minimum jackpout amount at which a photo will
  be taken of the player. The photo can be seen or downloaded using the Web UI. This is an experimental feature and is NOT RECOMMENDED 
  for novice users as it requires modification of the cabinet or player tracking bracket to accommodate the camera. This feature is also 
  only compatible with the MAGSTRIPE version due to limits in the SPI bus. Please see the Addendum PDF in the download for more information. 
  I make no promises that this code will make it into the main branch.
  
   Build 20210425 Updates
  
  - Adds support for 8-bit LCDs
  - Adds support for the Noritake CU20025ECPB-U1J display using the LiquidCrystal library in 8 bit mode
  - Updates to documentation including the make/model # of the supported magnetic reader
 
   Build 20210325 Updates
  
  - This build corrects many (if not all) of the compiler warnings generated by the code during compile; no other functional changes in this version
 
   Build 20210324 Updates
  
  - Fixes a potential issue in the setupPlayerMessage function where some pseudo-code was left in a conditional statement 
  - Fixes an issue in the MAG version where some debug code was left in a conditional statement when testing if SAS was available
  - Cleans up the waitForResponse function by removing the deprecated byte return value 

   Build 20210316 Updates
  
  - Fixes a bug in 20210314 where the web UI would not load properly - sorry about that!

   Build 20210314 Updates

  - Improved documentation

   Build 20210312 Updates
  
  - Fixes a bug where the Update Player Name function on the Web UI was not working properly
  - Game Manager: This version removes the ability to remotely update the index.htm file due to 
    a problem with the file being saved incorrectly by the Arduino - probably due to a buffer size
    issue; Will revisit this later. The config.txt file can still be updated from Game Manager.
   
   Build 20210306 Updates
  
  - Fixes a bug where the Player Total Winnings would not be calculated correctly
  - Fixes an error in the documentation regarding the Serial Tx/Rx pinouts

   Build 20210222 Updates
  
  - Adds support for updating SD card files (config.txt and index.htm) remotely using Game Manager; this feature is experimental
    and may be removed in a future release if issues arise; see documentation for details
  - Adds support for rebooting of Arduino board from Game Manager
    
  Build 20210219 Updates
  
  - Fixes a bug in 20210216 where the board would not set the sasOnline flag to true which
    prevented the RFID reader from working
  - Added a feature to enable periodic saving of player stats in case of loss of power to game
  - You will still need to apply the config.txt changes from the prior build to use this release
    
  Build 20210216 Updates
  * THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE CONFIG.TXT FILE IN THIS BUILD! PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CONFIG.TXT FILE
    AS PER THE DOCUMENTATION
    
  - Added support for Keypads, including Bally 6x2, 3x4 and ACT 8x2
  - Added support for the Admin Card; cardType 2
  - Added keypad-accessible Admin Controls

  - Added support for Time Sync with Game Manager host
  - Added additional messaging to display on game state changes
  - Fixed issue where player data would not be loaded if player card was left in machine at power-on
  - Fixed a few bugs in the SAS protocol implementation; also adds ACK/NACK responses to applicable commands
  - Package now includes Game Manager - a Windows App to manage your machines
  - Minor fixes to Web UI; you will need to replace the index.html file on your SD card(s) with the new one in the package
  - Updates and fixes to APTS card server; if using the card server you will need to update it and all of your machines at the same time because of
    message-format changes in this version
  - Significant code changes, refactoring and improvements
  - Improved documentation; now with pinouts for supported displays and keypads; Source code in-line comments also extensively updated

  Hardware requirements: 
    Arduino Mega 2560 R3; RFID RC 522 or compatible Magnetic Card Reader; W5100 Ethernet Shield; Serial Port board;
    Compatible vacuum fluorescent display or LCD; if using a display other than the default LCD then
    modifications will be required - see inline comments; Compatible keypad; if using a keypad other than
    the default Bally 6x2/3x4 then modifications will be required - see inline comments; Modifications will 
    be required if using another type of ethernet shield; Wifi shields are NOT recommended

  Software requirements:
    If using an IEE or Noritake VFD You will need my modified version of the libraries included in the zip file

  Upgrading from earlier versions:
    Be sure to check the sample config.txt file in the zip file for new or changed parameters that may be required
    for the new version

  For TITO Setup please follow the included documentation. This has been tested on IGT, Bally, WMS and Konami.

  Note: Remote access has been made compatible with BETTORSlots TITO apps for IOS/Android; BETTORSlots is
