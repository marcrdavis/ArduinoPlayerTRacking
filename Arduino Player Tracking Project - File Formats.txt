PLAYER AND CONFIG FILE FORMATS

The config file is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. A default file is included in the download. It has the following properties:

DisplayWidth=20  <- The width of your character display (columns)
DisplayHeight=2  <- The height of your character display (rows)
ScrollDelay=110  <- The scroll delay, in ms
logToSerial=1  <- Set to 1 to log output to the serial device, 0 if no 
LocalStorage=1  <- Set to 1 to store data to the local SD card; do not change this at this time
ssid=WIFISSIDHERE 
pass=WIFIPASSWORDHERE
BettorIPAddress=BETTORSLOTSIPADDRESSHERE
CasinoName=The CASINO  <- The name of your casino which will appear on the display
ScrollingText=Welcome to the Casino! Enjoy your stay! Please insert your Player Card
PlayerMessage=Welcome back [CARDHOLDER]! Enjoy your stay in The CASINO

[CARDHOLDER] is a variable you can use in the PlayerMessage to show the Cardholder’s name. Messages cannot exceed 256 characters.

The player file is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. The filename is based on the RFID Card ID, example: DA939819.TXT. On first use new cards automatically create a default file on the SD card with the following properties:

Cardholder=Player
CardType=1
PlayerTotalGames=0
PlayerGamesWon=0
PlayerGamesLost=0
PlayerTotalWon=0

The Cardholder field can be customized with any name up to 50 characters. The CardType property must be a 1. The other properties will be updated automatically during game play.
The System Bonus card is a standard .TXT file in a ‘property=value’ format. The filename is based on the RFID Card ID. A player card can be converted into a System Bonus card by replacing the file contents with these properties:

Cardholder=SYSTEM BONUS
CardType=3
CreditsToAdd=9999

The Cardholder must say ‘SYSTEM BONUS’. The CardType property must be a 3. You can set the CreditsToAdd property to be any number up to your max credits amount on the machine.

NOTE: CardType 2 is reserved for an Admin role.
